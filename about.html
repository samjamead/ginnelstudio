        <h1>About Ginnel Studio</h1>
        <p class="lead big-lead">Ginnel Studio is a (very) small website development and copywriting agency. You can find us wedged between two houses in Grouville, Jersey.</p>
        <p>Historically an alleyway through a terrace, at some point a wall went up the front and the back, and an extra house was squeezed in. Fast-forward 200-odd years, and that house is now home to Ginnel Studio.</p>
        <p>Most of the time it's a one-man band (so you have to question the use of the third person here), but when the need arises we can just about fit a superstar ensemble of back-end developers, marketers, and designers.</p>

        <p class="lead big-lead">Hello – I'm Sam, web developer, copywriter, and the hands behind Ginnel Studio.</p>
        <p>In the last 10 years I've done some other things, too: cofounded a SaaS tech startup; lead B2B marketing at a C-Series healthcare startup; and taught physics at high-school level.</p>
        <p>I write copy and build websites for all kinds of clients &mdash; some are very big, and some are just as small as Ginnel. This year I've worked with a marine conversation organisation, artists, engineers, and blockchain companies.

        <p>Whatever the brief, I'll find the tool for the job. I work with a wide variety of front-end platforms, from raw Javascript and CSS through to Wordpress and Squarespace.

        <p>I'm committed to helping those who are less fortunate than I am (as well as the planet). To that end I'm a member of Giving What We Can, One Percent for the Planet, and since September 2020 I've planted <span class="treespan">850</span> trees with <a href="https://ecologi.com/samuelmead?r=5f70ee1d77865f0019fd7d5b" target="_blank">Ecologi</a>.</p>
