project-intro:  "After partnering with British charity Blue Marine Foundation, Jersea needed an online home for all the         information hosted in their Fish of The Month campaign."
project-stack:  "This project kicked off with a copywriting brief. The Jersea project uses Squarespace to give their team flexbility in the future. Once the copy was ticked off, we designed the web layout, and built a bespoke Squarespace theme to suit."
