        <h1>Working with Ginnel Studio</h1>
        <p class="lead big-lead">Before we get to the hard bit, we'll have to get to know each other. We always start by listening &mdash;<p>
        <p>&mdash; you know, two ears, one mouth, that kind of thing. We'll explore your business, brand, and goals to set the tone for your project.</p>

    <h2>Part One: Briefing</h2>
    <p class="synopsis">In which brand is considered; goals are understood; scopes are discussed. </p>
    <p>Understanding the brief is simultaneously the most important and most difficult part of any project. It’s usually the hardest part for the client, too! Fortunately, I’ve been through this before. I’ll help you make absolutely sure that your brief is watertight before we get started. </p>

    <p>To really nail the brief, we’ll dive deep into your business’ goals. We’ll discuss what you’re hoping to get from the project; how that will that help you achieve your broader goals; and perhaps most significantly, how will we measure success? </p>

    <p>From your brief I’ll produce a detailed scope. The scope will make sure you’re absolutely clear on the work to be done, the output you can expect, and the total cost of the project. Don’t worry – <a href="#pricing">I’m not shy about pricing</a>!</p>

    <h2>Part Two: Benchmarking and Planning</h2>
    <p class="synopsis">In which data is analysed; sketches are sketched; plans are agreed. </p>
    <p>Now that we know what we’re aiming for, it’s time to figure out how to get there. To start with we’ll look at any data you have to better understand our starting point. We’ll also discuss any tools and services that we’ll use to deliver the project. </p>

    <p>Unlike many agencies, at Ginnel we’re not siloed into using a specific template or technology to deliver your project. We’re flexible, and prefer to use the right tool for the job – whatever is best to bring your project to life.</p>

    <h2>Part Three: Drafting and Development</h2>
    <p class="synopsis">In which code is written; words are typed; coffee is sipped. </p>
    <p>The easy part for you, and the fun part for me. Relax! </p>

    <h2>Part Four: Iteration </h2>
    <p class="synopsis">In which the red pen comes out; margins are tweaked; tests are performed. </p>
    <p>Feedback and revisions are what take firsts drafts from good to great, and then from great to world-class. I like to communicate frequently with clients, helping projects to go in exactly the right direction from the very beginning. </p>

    <p>Code and copy are both deployed for regular previews. Experience tells us that minor adjustments early on keep timelines on track, helping us get to launch that little bit quicker.</p>

    <h2>Part Five: Launch </h2>
    <p class="synopsis">In which switches are flicked; corks are popped; cake is cut.</p>
    <p>With the hard part done, it's time to enjoy the fruits of our labour. Of course, I won't just throw you the keys and leave you to it &mdash; I'll be helping you with any new tech, keeping an eye on performance and analytics, and making sure we've got the right data to compare against our benchmarks.</p>
    <p>Let the work take centre stage!</p>
